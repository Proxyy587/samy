### WIP: SAMY

SAMY stands for **Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube** (I like to think I'm quite creative with my naming skills!).

Most of us have playlists scattered between Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube, and there's really no simple way to keep everything in sync. 

**SAMY** aims to solve this by providing **real-time playlist synchronization** between your accounts on all three major music services. This means you can like a song on Spotify, and it’ll show up in your Apple Music and YouTube playlists automatically—or the other way around.

**Key goals:**
- Support real time playlist sync between YouTube, Apple Music, and Spotify
- Playlist converter.
- Privacy: Don't worry, I neither want nor store your logins, data, or “guilty pleasure” playlists (yes, all 473 Taylor Swift songs are safe). Im only here to help not judge!

This project is still a work in progress. If you'd like to contribute, please contact me via Discord or Instagram.

**The following npm packages are being used:**
- better-auth
- neon database/ serverless
- drizzle-orm
